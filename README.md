Aerial view of Fulham Cemetery with trees highlighted.

This is a single HTML page which shows an aerial image of Fulham Cemetery in JPG format, with an SVG graphic overlaid. Each group in the the SVG represents a tree or collection of trees using a circle or path and a text label, and the name of the tree is given by the id of the group. The tree labels are hidden by default. There is a separate table of contents or toc, which is list of tree names, positioned on the right-hand side of the map. When the user hovers over the tree shapes, the label becomes visible. When the user hovers over a tree name in the toc, only the matching trees in the SVG highlight and the other trees are hidden. 

The page is usable by mobile devices: The map scrolls horizontally and the JavaScript also checks for touch events.

The SVG is generated by a Figma file and used without changes, apart from adding an id attribute. It is extremely important that the LLM agent does not attempt to change the SVG in any other way.

This is deliberately a single HTML page, with all CSS and JavaScript and SVG embedded.
